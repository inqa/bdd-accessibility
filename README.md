**BDD Accessibility Testing**
For this project, I wanted to write a BDD project to perform accessibility scans on webpages.

This project uses Serenity, Selenium, Cucumber and aXe.
 
 See:
 Serenity: http://www.thucydides.info/#/
 Selenium: http://www.seleniumhq.org
 Cucumber JVM: https://cucumber.io/docs/reference/jvm
 aXe: http://www.deque.com/products/axe/

**Usage**
